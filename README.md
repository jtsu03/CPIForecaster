📈 CPI Forecaster (Inflation Time Series Analysis)

Forecasting U.S. inflation trends using historical CPI data and time-series modeling techniques.

📌 Project Overview

This project builds a time-series forecasting model for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to analyze historical inflation patterns and generate forward-looking projections. The goal is to demonstrate how economic time series data can be transformed into actionable forecasts that support planning, policy analysis, and financial decision-making.

The project emphasizes trend identification, seasonality, and forecast evaluation, rather than short-term market prediction.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical CPI trends and inflation dynamics

Identify seasonality and long-term movement in CPI data

Build a forecasting model to project future CPI values

Evaluate forecast accuracy using standard error metrics

📂 Data

Metric: Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Frequency: Monthly

Geographic Scope: United States

Source: Publicly available economic data (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics / FRED)

Data Preparation

Parsed and formatted CPI time series

Handled missing values and date alignment

Converted data into a time-series structure suitable for forecasting

🛠️ Methodology
1️⃣ Exploratory Time Series Analysis

Visualized CPI trends over time

Identified inflation cycles and long-run growth patterns

Examined seasonality and volatility

2️⃣ Forecasting Approach

Applied time-series forecasting techniques to model CPI behavior

Generated out-of-sample forecasts for future periods

Compared forecasted values against historical patterns for plausibility

3️⃣ Forecast Evaluation

Assessed performance using error metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📊 Key Insights

CPI exhibits strong long-term upward trends with identifiable inflationary cycles.

Forecasts capture overall direction and seasonality, while smoothing short-term noise.

Time-series forecasting provides useful macro-level guidance, even when precise monthly prediction is difficult.

This project focuses on trend forecasting, not point-precision inflation prediction.
